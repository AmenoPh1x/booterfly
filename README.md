# Booterfly
Booterfly is a sass/scss library that aims to work likke Twitter bootstrap but getting a full control over what is inside and what is not for our projects.
I takes some features over other existing frameworks adapted to our necessities that will help us to develop job faster and easier web structures and styling them.

This project is built using sass files, so if you need to make some changes for a specific project feel free to fork it and change all values to the needed.

If you find that it will be nice to add some additional features feel free to make a new branch and contact with the project responsible to add it in the next release. The responsible at this moment is Christian Amen√≥s (christian.amenos@gmail.com).

# Project structure

The project is structured in a way that will help you to find, edit and add new features easyly for that this is the folder structure you will find:

# Include in our projects

Once your sass files are compiled into our booterfly.css stylesheet you will be able to use it on your own projects adding it into your project header:
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/css/booterfly.css">
